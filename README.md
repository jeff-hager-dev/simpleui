#Description
A really simple library/module I wrote to accomplish two things: 

    1.Learn what it would take to wrap the CLI
    2.Learn a little bit about TKinter...why? well why not?

#Resources I used while researching:
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/665566/python-tkinter-shell-to-gui
- https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.stdin
